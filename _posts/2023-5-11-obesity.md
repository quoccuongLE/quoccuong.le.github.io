Obesity is an emerging problem in our society. A report by World Obesity Federation (WOF), an NGO, predicts that a staggering 50% of the  world population would be overweight or obese by 2035. This striking number is a wake up call for many parents to moderate their children’s food consumption and encourage them to participate in physical activities. It also raises a concern for governments to anticipate the looming healthcare costs of treating obesity-related conditions.
For adults, should they worry? A consensus would be reached easily if we start a poll. It is true that there is a heavy social prejudice against overweight people, especially women. The standard of beauty has evolved from ample bodies, which indicate fertility, in the Medieval times, in modern society thin bodies are more desirable, as they show wealth and diligence.

Surveys in many developed countries show a significant correlation between weight and income of an individual, as overweight people earn less than their fit and thinner peers. One of the most popular reasons is the stereotype about the incompetencies of fat people, that obese workers are slow, clumsy and too fragile to work long hours and tend to take longer breaks. Being obese is undeniably unhealthy, as staying fit by avoiding processed foods and doing exercise regularly is iterated by doctors and nutritionists.
There are several specific jobs which require good looking appearance and appropriate weight -   air hosts, for example. The US airlines industry has imposed strict conditions on physical appearance on cabin crews. Except for the mentioned example, in general, overweight people are as competent as their slimmer counterparts. However, a study conducted in the US in the 80s displayed that the discrimination against fat people in workplace is not due to their appearance, but the lack of education which did not permit them to have a higher position in the company.

Many efforts have been made to attenuate the consequences of the stereotypes including legal protections. In many places, obesity is added into a novel category of disability. This approach seems clever, but has some flaws. In many cases when victims were discriminated by their appearance, the disability-focused laws were not effective because the individuals were not disabled by their weight.
There seems to be no easy solution for the problem, except getting thinner by regulating nutrition intake, and doing exercise. The efforts should also come from governments by controlling the fast-food industries, adding a higher tax on junk food. However, the pace of the battle might change quickly since the introduction of a new drug called GLP-1.
WeGovy – the name of the drug- developed by Nova Nordisk, after completing the trial with positive results, are taking the market. The obesity drug came by serendipity. When it was first introduced, it was meant to treat diabetics, but its side effect caused patients to lose weight. Its effectiveness on obese patients is splendid. The company is planning to gear up the production in America and Europe and is set to conquer the global market soon. … To be continue …
