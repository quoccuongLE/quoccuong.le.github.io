<h2 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}class="text-white"{% endif %}>My story</h2>
<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}">I am a Research Engineer/Scientist in Machine Learning & Computer Vision, based in Issy-les-Moulineaux, France (in parisian region or Île-de-France).</p>
<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}">I obtained my engineering degree in electronic and informatics from INSA (Institut National des Sciences Appliquées) de Centre Val de Loire (Blois, France) in 2016, as well as my Master's degree in Robotic, Control and Signal Processing at Université d'Orléan. Later I earned my doctorate in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at Université de Tours. The topic of my thesis was to develop a collaborative multi-camera tracking system, which was part of a research project, named LUMINEUX - or 'luminous' in English, aiming to develop a system of intelligent sensors in city for smart street lighting, traffic control, etc.</p>
<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}">After finishing my PhD in 2020, I joined a start-up, named <a href="https://xxii.fr/">XXII Group</a>, based at Puteaux (next to Paris), France to develop a video analytic platform, called XXII-SmartCity/Infra, which analyses videos from cameras in real-time to detect incidents, traffic monitoring, etc. The system are deployed in multiple cites across France, Europe and the US.</p>
